Cyborg Sense Augmentation - Educational Device Development

We will develop a wearable sensory augmentation device  based on the NorthPaw (https://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/).
The NorthPaw is a wearable anklet that features small vibrating elements arranged in a circle around the ankle. Using an electronic compass, it is designed such that the vibrator element closest to magnetic north vibrates, giving the wearer a constant sense of magnetic direction. According to one of the NorthPaw developers, he “developed an unerring sense of direction” and that his brain “developed new mapping abilities”.  
We’d like to build at least two of these devices, so that students in a future offering of PHIL 185C course can make use of them. One significant theme of the course will be the cyborg augmentation and alteration of sensory capacities. The NorthPaw is no longer available for sale, but their website describes how to build the device. We are excited about our support from the Hive (https://colleges.claremont.edu/thehive/) to build these devices.
